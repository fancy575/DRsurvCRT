Description: Cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) randomize groups (clusters) rather than
    individuals. Valid CRT analysis requires distinguishing cluster-level and individual-level
    treatment effects and defining estimands under potential outcomes. For right-censored
    survival outcomes, treatment effects are commonly summarized by contrasts of survival
    functions (SPCE) or restricted mean survival times (RMST). This package formalizes
    cluster- and individual-level estimands for CRTs with survival endpoints and implements
    doubly robust (DR) estimators under covariate-dependent censoring. The DR estimators are
    consistent if either the censoring model or the outcome model is correctly specified.
    Users may choose marginal Cox or gamma-frailty working models for the nuisance fits.
    Jackknife (leave-one-cluster-out) variance and interval estimation is provided.
