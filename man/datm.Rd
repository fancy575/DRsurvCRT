\title{Simulated multi-state CRT survival data (long format)}
\format{
A data frame with \code{N} rows and 9 variables:
\describe{
\item{id}{Individual identifier. Each subject may appear on multiple rows.}
\item{time}{Observed time of the record (e.g., transition time or censoring
time). Times are non-decreasing within an \code{id}.}
\item{event}{Multi-state event indicator. The coding is:
\itemize{
\item \code{0} = still at-risk / no new transition (often the last
row for a censored subject);
\item \code{1}, \code{2}, \code{3} = entry into progressively
more severe event states (e.g., non-fatal event, progression,
death), in increasing clinical priority.
}
Not every subject experiences all states; some may be censored earlier.}
\item{cluster}{Integer cluster identifier.}
\item{trt}{Cluster-level treatment indicator; \code{0} = control,
\code{1} = intervention. Constant within cluster.}
\item{W1}{Cluster-level baseline binary covariate.}
\item{W2}{Cluster-level baseline continuous covariate.}
\item{Z1}{Individual-level continuous baseline covariate.}
\item{Z2}{Individual-level binary baseline covariate.}
}

\description{
A simulated cluster-randomized trial (CRT) dataset with a \emph{multi-state}
prioritized endpoint and right censoring, stored in long format. Each
individual can experience up to several ordered event types, and contributes
multiple rows with increasing \code{time}. The data are designed to
illustrate the multi-state SPCE and RMT-IF estimators in \pkg{DRsurvCRT}.
}
\details{
For each subject \code{id}, rows are ordered by \code{time}. If an individual
transitions to a new state (e.g., from state 0 to 1, or from 1 to 2, etc.),
the corresponding transition time is recorded with \code{event > 0}. Later
rows for the same subject may reflect further transitions or censoring.

This structure is suitable for constructing state-specific transformed
survival functions \eqn{S_{a,s}(t)} (for treatment arm \eqn{a} and
state \eqn{s}) and for computing stage-wise RMT-IF contributions for
prioritized composite endpoints. It is the canonical example dataset used
by the multi-state core and jackknife routines in \pkg{DRsurvCRT}.
